# Government Budget Analysis
## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing government spending by department using Pythonâ€™s pandas, Matplotlib, and NumPy libraries. The project reads financial data from a CSV file, processes and analyzes the budget allocation and expenditures, and visualizes the results to provide insights into spending patterns and budget utilization.
## Features

* Load and preprocess government budget data from a CSV file
* Perform quantitative analysis on budget allocation and expenditures
* Visualize spending patterns and budget distributions using Matplotlib
* Generate insights into departmental spending efficiency

## Prerequisites

* Python 3.7 or higher
* pip (Python package installer)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

        git clone https://github.com/yourusername/financial_budget-analysis.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:

        cd financial_budget-analysis

3. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

        python -m venv venv

4. Activate the virtual environment:

        Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

       MacOS/Linux: source venv/bin/activate

5. Install the required packages:

        pip install -r requirements.txt

## Data

* CSV File: The project expects a CSV file containing government budget data. Ensure the CSV file includes columns such as Department, Allocated_Budget, Spent_Budget, and Fiscal_Year. Place this file in the data directory and name it Usa_budget_2023.csv.

## Results

* Quantitative Analysis: Metrics such as total allocated and spent budgets, and budget utilization ratios.
* Visualizations: Bar charts comparing allocated and spent budgets by department, providing a clear view of spending patterns.
